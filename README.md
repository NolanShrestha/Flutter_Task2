### Notable Widgets used 

- InkWell: The InkWell widget responds to touch with a ripple effect. It is often used to make any widget or area of the screen tappable, giving visual feedback when tapped. This makes it a common choice for creating buttons, clickable areas, or interactive elements in your UI.

- AlertDialog: The AlertDialog widget creates a dialog box with optional title, content, and action buttons. It is typically used to present critical information, confirm actions, or prompt user input.

- DropdownButton : DropdownButton widget is used to create a dropdown menu from which users can select one value from a list of options. It provides a customizable UI component for choosing values in forms or interactive features.

- ListTile: The ListTile widget provides a convenient way to create a single fixed-height row containing text, icons, and other elements. It's commonly used in lists, menus, or any area where rows of information need to be displayed.

- ListView: The ListView widget is a scrollable list of widgets. It's one of the most commonly used widgets for building vertical or horizontal scrolling lists, such as menus, chat screens, or long forms.

- BoxShadow: The BoxShadow widget is used to add shadows to a container or box-like widget. It's part of the BoxDecoration class and is typically used with widgets like Container to create visually appealing designs.

- ClipRect: The ClipRect widget is used to clip its child using a rectangle. It effectively limits the drawing area of its child to a rectangular boundary, which is defined by its size or an optional custom clipping behavior.

- BottomNavigationBar: The BottomNavigationBar widget is used to create a bottom navigation bar that allows users to switch between different sections or pages of an app. It's a common feature in apps with multiple main screens.

- GridView: The GridView widget is used to display items in a grid layout. It is highly customizable and is often used for presenting content like images, products, or lists in a structured and visually appealing way.


### HTTP package

- The http package is a popular library used to send HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, to interact with remote servers or APIs. It is often used for fetching data from a server or sending data to it. In this project a RESTful API was created using Strapi V5.5.
